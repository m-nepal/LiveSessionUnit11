# LiveSessionUnit11
This project is justt for keeping track of assignment submitted for <a href="https://datascience.smu.edu/">**MSDS-6306@SMU**</a> as an example of  **Forecasting: principles and practice(FPP)**. 
* a)	Plot the time series. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend? 
* b)	Use a classical decomposition to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices. 
* c)	Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part (a)? 
* d)	Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data. 
* e)	Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 500 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier? 
* f)	Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series? 
* g)	Use STL to decompose the series.
